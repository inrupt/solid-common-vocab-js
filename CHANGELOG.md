# Changelog

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

## 1.0.0 2021/10/11

- Open sourcing.

### Deprecation notice

- With Node.js version 10 [reaching end-of-life on
  2021-04-30](https://github.com/nodejs/Release),
  @inrupt/solid-common-vocab no longer actively supports it. It will not
  stop working right away, but it will no longer be actively tested and no
  special effort will be made to keep it from breaking.

## 0.5.3

### Internal refactor

- Replaced `@rdfjs/data-model` with `rdf-data-factory` (as it provides full
TypeScript compatibility with the RDF/JS DataFactory type).
- Only require RDF/JS implementation as a Dev dependency as opposed to a full
dependency (meaning users of this library are completely free to depend on
whatever implementation they choose).

## 0.5.2

### Patches

- Export useful RDF/JS types directly.

## 0.4.2

### Patches

- Fixed the license SPDX in `package.json`.
